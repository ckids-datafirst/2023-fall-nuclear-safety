,190,"On January 11, 2018, the CPUC voted unanimously to adopt Decision D. 18-01- 022 approving PG&E's Application to retire Diablo Canyon by 2025, approving PG&E's recovery in its rates the costs associated with the retirement of the power plant; costs incurred for license renewal expenses; to retain Diablo Canyon employees until scheduled closing, and to retrain workers. The Decision, which was issued on January 16, 2018, in approving $211.3 million and not the $352.1 million sought by PG&E did not approve full funding by the ratepayers for the Employee Retention Program as proposed in PG&E's its Application and instead directed, consistent with the Proposed Decision, that the ratepayer-supported
employee retention incentive payments be reduced from 25% to 15% per year. The CPUC denied in its entirety PG&E's request to recover in its rates the Community Impact Mitigation funding provided to the San Luis Obispo area and determined that consideration of electricity procurement to replace Diablo Canyon power should be addressed in the CPUC's Integrated Resources Planning procurement proceedings. In October 2018, the Commission denied an Application for Rehearing of Decision 18-01-022 filed by the group Californians for Green Nuclear Power.","Questioning Attitude;

15-16, 2022 Public Meeting",278,Root Cause Evaluation for Failed Auxiliary Saltwater Pump Motor - Mr. McWhorter state Auxiliary Saltwater System (ASW) pump 1-2 failed in Jul 2021 when a routine changeover of ASW pumps on Unit 1 triggered a ground alarm in the Control Room. Operators shut down ASW pump 1-2 and ASW pump 1-1 was left runnning. Mr. McWhorter reported the root cause evaluation (RCE) established the failure was due to contamination inside the motor and while the motor could have possibly remained in service the decision was made to replace the motor.

He reported this event was a Reactivity Management Level 4 event in a scale of Levels 1-6 with 6 being the most severe. Mr. McWhorter reported the avoidance of inadvertent changes in reactor power is a fundamental tenet of operations. The cause was operators failing to recognize that a surveillance test on a valve in the boric acid addition system had failed to close a valve before they commenced a second test, such that when the second test began boric acid entered the RCS.

,616,"Given the straightforward failure mechanism for the motor, the Cause Evaluation (which was almost complete at the time of this Fact-Finding Meeting but had not been formally approved) was focusing more on the programmatic deficiencies that led to the failure. Specifically, personnel participating in the Cause Evaluation were concerned that the safety-related ASW Pump motor was known to be in a degraded condition, but corrective actions were not initiated in a timely manner to prevent the failure. Additionally, there was no monitoring in place for a known degraded motor heater which ultimately failed without being detected by operators.","Problem Identification and Resolution;

The FFT reviewed the 17 demonstration criteria that were not satisfactorily completed and found that most were minor and were addressed via discussion during the facility critiques. Approximately 29 Notifications were written to initiate corrective actions for deficiencies and other shortcomings identified during exercise preparation and execution. PG&E’s evaluation also described the exercise which caused several control board indications to freeze and was the source of the confusion over the units and trends for Containment pressure observed by the DCISC as noted above. ,"Problem Identification and Resolution;

Maintenance replaced the pump motor and an emergency change to the Technical Specification was initiated to allow an increase in time to replace the motor from 72 hours to 144 hours because of physical constraints due to the pump's location within the Intake Structure.
