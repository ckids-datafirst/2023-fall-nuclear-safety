        This [Fall 2023](https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/editions/2023-fall/#dates) [DataFirst project](https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/) addressed the problem of [mapping nuclear safety issues with nuclear safety traits](/content/problem-statement/). It uses data from [annual reports generated by Diablo Canyon Independent Safety Culture](/content/data/). Our work focuses on [using NLP and LLMs to classify safety issues according to safety culture traits](/content/approach/). Our initial results indicate [Claude-2 LLM achieved 79% accuracy in classifying safety issues](/content/results/).

        Our motivation to address this problem stems from the critical importance of nuclear safety culture in preventing disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima, especially considering Diablo Canyon's role in providing 10% of California's energy supply.
