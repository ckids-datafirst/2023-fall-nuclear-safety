It should be no more than 3 pages long. It should be done after or in combination with the Requirements document. It should have an initial release after no more than eight weeks into the project, and can serve as an interim project report. It can be refined as the project progresses and the problem is better understood.\nData Quality Describe any steps that were used to address any issues concerning the quality of the data. This may include collecting data quality metrics, discarding subsets of the data, or applying specific techniques for handling missing values, dealing with outliers, etc.\nRaw Annual Reports are extracted from the DCISC website (https://www.dcisc.org/annual-reports/). The focus of this project is on the 32nd Annual Report. We read through the entire report, manually extracted all potential issue statements, labeled them according to the INPO Traits of a Healthy Nuclear Safety Culture handout, and provided reasons for the classification to form the finalized gold standard dataset. There are both textual and imagery inputs inside the report. Thus, optical characteristic recognition (OCR) is required to extract the entire report. The data quality is low as the issue statement is scattered across the report without clear patterns. In addition, many of the issue statements lack detailed descriptions or the root cause report inside the annual report, which requires additional documentation. Data Preprocessing Describe the steps taken to preprocess the raw data to prepare it for analysis. This may include data transformations to convert to a required format, feature engineering operations, encoding features as binary, etc.\nWe used OCR via Python since many issue statements are mentioned with the imagery format rather than text. After the OCR, we can get a txt file that is readable for the machine for the issue statement extraction task (left for next semester’s project). Manually extracted and labeled all issue statements using the INPO Traits of a Healthy Nuclear Safety Culture to form the golden standard csv dataset. Vectorize the issue statements and ten safe traits so the LLMs can read them. Build additional seed words and secondary seed words based on the previous team’s effort. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) After finalizing the CSV dataset, we visualized the distribution of the safety traits, which shows the imbalanced issue and reveals the top safety traits related to the issues. Model Development Seed Word Model: – Python libraries: spacy and scikit-learn – The classic NLP method recommended by Professor Ulf also provided a good baseline for the previous team. – We utilized the previous team’s seed words on the first try and achieved 53% accuracy with a 47% F1 score. – Added weights for safety traits to counter data imbalance issues and added additional seed words to make the model more comprehensive.\nLogistic Regression Model: – Python libraries: scikit-learn – Vectorized the dataset to help with large textual dataset analysis. – Use 10-fold cross-validation and get ten accuracy scores for each logistic regression model\nLarge Language Models: – Fine-tuned the model with the INPO Traits of a Healthy Nuclear Safety Culture handout – Formed output format to include the original/summarized issue statement in one column, traits it labeled with along with the confidence level in one column, and reasoning for the third column. Finally, label all issue statements inside the dataset with the required table format. – We tried both ChatGPT3.5 and Claud-2 from perplexity using a similar process. – Here is the link for the ChatGPT3.5 model we fine-tuned, including the process and the result: https://chat.openai.com/share/34046a4f-ca87-4311-8fcb-6b1b83764578\nModel Evaluation We utilized accuracy and F-1 score to evaluate the model performance. We use cross-validation for the overfitting check and model performance evaluation for the Logistic Regression model.

The diablo canyon nuclear power plant is the focus of this project, which is also the last operating nuclear power plant inside the state of California. Given the tragical incidences from Cernobyl in 1986 and from Fukushima in 2011, it is important to make this plant operates safely until scheduled closing by 2030.\nProblem for the Semester We need to identify the issue statment in side the 32nd annual report, form a golden standard where we manually labeled each statement using the ten healthy traits provided in the INPO report. After that, we aim to build models that can automate the labeling processure with reasonable model performance. There should be base line models and LLM models working in parallel so that we could compare the model performances and form a solid ground for the next semster’s project.\nState of the Art Advanced Large Language Models (LLM) can be state-of-the-art tools to implement for this project. Additional Machine Learning models such as Logistic Regression, KMeans, and traditional NLP methods like seed word are implemented in parallel via Python as the comparison group. Design and Approach We split the document among each team member to get extract and labeled the issue statements to form the dataset. With the help of professor Ulf, we finalized the baseline model selection and choose additional state-of-art models as comparison group. The input for the issue statement model should be the entire annual report, and this model should have both the ability to do Optical Characterisitc Recognition (OCR), and also sentiment analysis or seed word extraction so that it could extract the issue statement as the output. The input for all label classification models should be each issue statement, and the output should be the label(s) the model assigned with along with the confidence level and reasoning behind it. We use seed word model as the baseline model, using the seed word from previous team as the base model. The main issue includes unbalanced healthy traits inside the issue statement dataset, and limited seed word is presented. Some clear improvements includes assigning weights to minority traits and put second-layered seed words. Moving from the seed word base line, we initiated the logistic regression and kmeans clustering models to set additional base line models to explore more potential directions. At the same time, we utilized multiple the state-of-art LLM models and finalized with claud-2 and GPT3.5 models. We test all models on the dataset to compare model performances. (An overview diagram for our system design) Use Case Scenario Researchers who want to investigate the operation of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant healthy traits, or compare different years’ performance to determine the main focus of future improvements.\nFor instance, the researcher download the annual report pdf from 21st to 33rd, then put one report at a time into the system. Then, he would be able to get a list of healthy traits for each year, with stats and visualizations to better understand the key issues. To compare the trend, the researcher can look at different charts to determine the leadership performance, or if there are any long-lasting safety traits that are being ignored during daily operations.\nDesired Outcomes and Benefits The desired outcome would include a well-designed dashboard that connect with well-performing models we built. The user would simply put as many annual reports as they want, and the system would analyze what issue statments are and their safety traits, make interactive visualizations that help user to get a comprehensive view of the report.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701393210,"objectID":"b7c3446bb0d5d7e8a477294017361379","permalink":"https://ckids-datafest.github.io/template-project-website/problem-statement/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/template-project-website/problem-statement/","section":"","summary":"title: Problem and Requirements summary: Problem and Requirements document that will drive the work to be done in the project date: “2023-11-28T00:00:00Z” editable: true share: false Introduction This project, which will be co-advised by Dr.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"}]
